            <h1> Aeon Refractor Case - </h1>
            <img class="preview-img" src="../images/rf1.png"></img>
            <p><b> Refractor - </b>
                  This is a Klon Centaur clone.
                  I started with laying out the hole spacing.
            </p>
            <img class="preview-img" src="../images/rf2.png"></img>
            <p><b> Enlarge the holes - </b>
                  After the knob layout was set,
                  the holes get the final drill size.
            </p>
            <img class="preview-img" src="../images/rf3.png"></img>
            <p><b> Etching - </b>
                  I painted the surface with clear nail polish,
                  then scratched the knob labels and artwork with a stick.
                  Then used a 6amp DC battery charger, vinegar and a Q-tip
                  to remove material from the non-painted areas.
            </p>
            <img class="preview-img" src="../images/rf4.png"></img>
            <p><b> Polish - </b>
                  Smooth out the surface and the artwork begins to show up.
                  The areas inside the letters G and O are a little to
                  agressively etched, but it's unique.
                  It can be left like this, but this one is
                  ready to receive paint.
            </p>
            <img class="preview-img" src="../images/rf5.png"></img>
            <p><b> Painting - </b>
                  The paint is applied to fill the etching.
                  Then it will be polished smooth again
                  to produce a flush colored effect.
            </p>
            <img class="preview-img" src="../images/rf6.png"></img>
            <p><b> Final Polish - </b>
                  This is the last time it gets polished, then assembled.
                  It could be clear coated for a more refined look,
                  but I like this one just like it is.
                  This one gets some miniature Davies knobs to emulate it's namesake.

          <!-- Aeon Refractor Circuit Board -->

          <div class="preview">
            <h1> Refractor Board </h1>
            <img class="preview-img" src="../images/rf9.png"></img>
            <p><b> Work Space - </b>
                  List of materials, parts, solder and coffee.
                  Each part gets found and checked with a multimeter
                  before getting pushed through the board
                  and checked off the list.
            </p>
            <img class="preview-img" src="../images/rf8.png"></img>
            <p><b> Time to Solder - </b>
                  Typically parts are soldered from shortest
                  to tallest. The resisters are usually first,
                  and the electrolytic capcitors are usually last.
            </p>
            <img class="preview-img" src="../images/rf7.png"></img>
            <p><b> Top View - </b>
                  This has most of the parts applied except the sockets
                  for the IC's and a few odd sized parts.
            </p>
            <img class="preview-img" src="../images/rf10.png"></img>
            <p><b> Assembly Complete - </b>
                  Everything fits snug with plenty of room. You can see the
                  daughter board on the switch and the covered jacks on
                  this one. Box capacitors were used to keep a cleaner look.
            </p>

            <h1> Aeon Blues Breaker </h1>
            <img class="preview-img" src="../images/bb1.png"></img>
            <p><b> Blues Breaker - </b>
                  This is a Blues Breaker clone. You can see the paint process
                  is identical to the Refractor. From this angle you can see the
                  socketed clipping stages to make adjustments. So far no changes are needed.
            </p>
            <img class="preview-img" src="../images/bb2.png"></img>
            <p><b> Assembly Complete - </b>
                  Straight forward as you can see. I direct wired the switch on this one,
                  but used a daughter board on the next project. I didn't have a preference
                  They both worked fine.
            </p>
            <img class="preview-img" src="../images/bb3.png"></img>
            <p><b> Top View </b>
                  The fine lettering was a little more fiddly than I hoped.
                  It's readable, but I needed to etch the line a little deeper
                  to hold more paint.
            </p>

            <p><b> SHO - </b>
                  The SHO is a boost circuit that offers unity gain
                  to 60X, while adding high-end clarity
                  by utilizing a 5 million ohm input impedance.
